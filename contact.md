## contacts

I'm the author and the **wannabe redteamer** mentioned elsewhere in this website.
Like many others in the field, I consider offensive security to be my main area of study and my main headache reason... also called passion.

I'm always eager to learn and improve. If you'd like to discuss anything related to this topic, feel free to reach out. You'll find my contact information below.
